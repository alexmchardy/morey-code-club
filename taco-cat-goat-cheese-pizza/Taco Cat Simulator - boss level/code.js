// Build a Taco-cat-goat-cheese-pizza Simulator
// and learn about variables

// Declare a variable named "cardCounter" and assign 0 to it
var cardCounter = 0;
// Declare a variable and assign an array (list) of strings (words) to it
var cardList = ["taco", "cat", "goat", "cheese", "pizza"];
// Declare three variables and leave them empty
var sayWord, cardWord, randNum;

// TODO: Every time the "Play" button is clicked:
//  1. Set sayWord to the NEXT card in cardList, and use setText() to show it
//  2. Set cardWord to a RANDOM card in cardList, and use setText() to show it
//  3. If sayWord equals cardWord, use showElement() to show the "slapImage"



// Variations:
// - Play a sound when the slap happens
// - Change the card words or add new ones
// - Have the simulator actually say the words like a player would
// - Add pictures to the cards
// - Delay the slap slightly
// - Simulate multiple players
